                                    <p>In my earlier research, I examined the strategic use of narrative persuasion in health promotion and disease prevention. For example, my PhD dissertation examined the effects of several language and content features of. At the same time, it also identified a serial mediation relationship which distinguishes narratives from other ordinary persuasion effort. I recently started a project investigating the impact of the linguistic cues and rhetoric features of narratives in online social support solicitation built on my earlier research on narrative persuasion and online social support.</p>
