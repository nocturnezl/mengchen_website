My name is Meng Chen, and I am an Assistant Professor in the Media Communications Department at Webster Vienna Private University (WVPU), Austria. I am also an affiliated faculty member at WVPU's Department of Business and Marketing. 

​
I obtained my Ph.D. in Health Communication from the University of California, Daivs (2018) and my M.A. in Mass Communication from the University of Houston (2011). I graduated with one B.A. in Chinese Literature & Linguistics from Beijing International Studies University (2009).



My research interests lie at the intersection of health communication, new media, and language use and effects. I primarily study language use and effects in digital health communication under various contexts, such as health promotion, public crisis journalism, and social support. I employ a variety of research methods, such as social experiments, content analysis, computational analysis, etc. My studies have been published in a number of leading peer-reviewed journals such as Psychology & Health, Communication Research, Computers in Human Behavior, Journal of Health Psychology, Journal of Health Communication, Health Communication.
