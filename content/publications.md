How powerful is language in shaping people's minds and behaviors? Would it become more powerful when combined with the emerging media? How can we make the best use of the language rhetoric in the digital era to prevent disease, seek social support, or manage health? The emergence of the new media has dramatically changed the way people communicate, promote, and manage health. My research program investigates language use in digital health communication and its effects in various contexts, including public health crisis journalism, patients' social support solicitation, and disease prevention.
